abstract: 'One approach to the analysis of inequality is based on the concept of intersectionality, which is also known as “intersectional discrimination.” In this approach, it is assumed that economic and social inequalities are not solely a consequence of a person’s position within the production structure (ie a person’s class position) but are also a result of other factors and categories, such as gender, according to which people can be classified. The concept of intersectionality can therefore be used to gain an understanding of the processes by which class and gender, taken together, give rise to differentiated access to opportunities and resources.
This study focuses on measuring the intersectionality of class and gender and on gauging how these two factors influence job quality. Using the class-based scheme proposed by Erik O. Wright (1994) as a point of departure, an effort is made to quantify the ways in which class, gender and the intersection of these two factors translate into variations in job quality, with the latter being analysed on the basis of multidimensional measurements of objective and subjective employment and working conditions.'
