abstract: 'For several decades the transformation of the class structure in advanced capitalist societies was analysed through the lens of two opposing theses. A variety of analysts highlighted the advent of a post-industrial, post-capitalist or programmed society, which meant the consolidation of a large middle class that was defined as one of the main classes of capitalism in the second half of the twentieth century (Bell, 1973; Dahrendorf, 1959; Touraine, 1971). These authors interpreted the phenomenon as the result of the de-proletarization of the post-industrial work process; in other words, as a consequence of how that process started to require a more skilled labour force, with higher levels of technical knowledge and autonomy. Some even claimed that the transformations in question would give rise to a “new class” that would significantly alter the foundational patterns of wage labour (Mallet, 1975; Touraine, 1971).
In contrast to this perspective, other analysts projected an image of capitalist development centred on the concept of “proletarianization”. Starting with the famous study by Harry Braverman (1998), many argued that the transformation of the class structure in the second half of the twentieth century instead expressed a tendency for wage earners to lose control over the work process, along with the development of highly routine work subject to “top-down” control (Wright and Singelmann, 1982).'
