abstract: In recent years, scholars have used the concepts of structural and associational power to distinguish between the power derived from workers’ location in the economic system and the power resulting from workers’ collective formation of collective organization (Wright, 2000; Silver, 2003; Schmalz, et al, 2018). This article extends the notion of associational power to examine both worker and capitalist collective power. To do so, it compares how, since Chile’s democratic restoration in 1990, Chilean workers and employers have organized in the Workers Unitary Central (CUT) and the Confederation of Production and Commerce (CPC). Then, through an analysis of a recent labor reform (2015 – 2016), the article shows how employers have been more successful in influencing the policymaking process than workers (e.g. how the CPC managed to defend the pro-business regulations inherited from the Pinochet dictatorship).

The article argues that this disparity in the power to influence policymaking is the expression of a disparity of associational power. This is observed in the contrast between the CPC’s ability to mobilize employers and forge class-wide solidarity and consensus and the CUT’s inability to overcome threats to working-class unity derived from political and partisan cleavages. After reflecting on the factors that explain this disparity of associational power, the article suggests that: 1. Associational power must be understood as a capacity (to organize and mobilize) rather than a resource (Brookes, 2018), 2. Associational power is key for advancing class interests: only when associational power is strong, can classes mobilize more effectively power resources such as partisan linkages; 3. The relationship between different types of power is complex: some power resources (e.g. union-party linkages) can become detrimental for the construction of associational power if they increase intra-class divisions; and 4. Studying working-class power requires analyzing how it shapes and is shaped by employer power.
