abstract: The Political Economy of Work in the Global South is a book that addresses key issues of the Labour Process Theory (lpt). By examining the changing dynam-ics  of  work  and  employment  in  the  Global  South,  the  book  thus  contributes  to lpt  by  presenting  evidence  on  political  economies  that  have  been  largely  understudied in the existing research
